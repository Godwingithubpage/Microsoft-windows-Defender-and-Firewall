**Introduction**
Hi, I'm Godwin, currently pursuing a BSc Honours in Cybersecurity with The Open University, UK. This project is a part of my journey to deepen my understanding and skills in computer security. Microsoft Windows Defender is an integrated security solution that safeguards your computer against malware and other security threats. In this project, I detailed how to find Virus and Threat Protection settings, perform a quick scan using Windows Defender Antivirus, and configure Windows Firewall rules.

**Locating Virus and Threat Protection Settings**
To find the Virus and Threat Protection settings:

Click on the Start menu and choose Settings (gear icon).
In the Settings window, select Update & Security.
In the left sidebar, click on Windows Security.
Under Protection areas, select Virus & threat protection.
This is where you can access and modify various security settings related to virus and threat protection.

Running Quick Scan with Windows Defender
To run a quick scan with Windows Defender Antivirus:

Follow the steps above to access the Virus & threat protection settings.
In the Quick scan section, click the Quick scan button.
Windows Defender will initiate a scan of your computer for malware and threats. This process might take some time.
After the scan is complete, you'll receive a report on the scan results. If any threats are identified, follow the recommended actions to address them.

**Configuring Windows Firewall Rules**
Learn how to configure Windows Firewall rules:

Press the Start button and choose Control Panel.
In the Control Panel, select System and Security.
Click on Windows Defender Firewall.
In the left sidebar, choose Advanced settings.
Here, you can create new inbound or outbound rules by clicking on the respective option in the left sidebar.
Follow the prompts to specify the rule's settings, such as allowing or blocking specific programs or ports.
